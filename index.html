      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>After a shitty party we decided to call it a day. And we began thinking of a smart way to plan our next party, where we could easily distribute roles among the organisation team, share ideas, and split expenses.</p>
      <p>I was a terror since the public school era
          Bathroom passes, cutting classes, squeezing asses
          Smoking blunts was a daily routine
          Since thirteen, a chubby nigga on the scene
          I used to have the tre' duce
          And the duce duce in my bubble-goose
          Now I got the mack in my knapsack
          Loungin' black, smoking sacks up in acts
          And sidekicks with my sidekicks rocking fly kicks
          Honeys want to chat
          But all we want to know is "where the party at?"
          And can I bring my gat?
          If not, I hope I don't get shot
          Betta throw my vest on my chest
          Cause niggas is a mess
          It don't take nothin' but frontin'
          For me to start somethin'
          Buggin' and barkin' at niggas like I was duck huntin'
          Dumbing out, just me and my crew
          Cause all we want to do is
          Party, and bullshit, and [Repeat: x9]
          Hugs from the honeys, pounds from the roughnecks
          Seen my man see that I knew from the projects
          Said he had beef, asked me if I had my piece
          Sure do, two .22's in my shoes
          Holler if you need me love I'm in the house
          Roam and strollin' see what the honeys is about
          Moet popping, hoe hopping, ain't no stopping big poppa, I'm a bad boy
          Niggas want to front, who got your back? (biggie!)
          Niggas want to flex, who got the gat? (biggie!)
          It ain't hard to tell I'm the east coast overdoser
          Nigga you scared you're supposed to
          Nigga I toast ya, put fear in your heart
          Fuck up the party before it even start
          Pissy drunk, off the henny and stuff
          Or some brand-Nubian shit beatin' down punks!
          Party, and bullshit, and [Repeat: x9]
          Bitches in the back looking righteous
          In a tight dress, I think I might just
          Hit her with a little biggie 101, how to tote a gun
          And have fun with Jamaican rum
          Conversations, blunts in rotation
          My man big Jacques got the glock in his waist and
          We're smoking, drinking, got the hooker thinking
          If money smell bad than this nigga biggie stinking
          Is it my charm? I got the hookers eating out my palm
          She grabbed my arm and said "let's leave calm"
          I'm hittin' skins again
          Rolled up another blunt, bought a Heineken
          Niggas start to loke out, a kid got choked out
          Blows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out
          Can't we just all get along?
          So I can put hickies on her chest like lil' shawn
          Get her pissy drunk off of don perrignon
          And it's on, and I'm gone
          That's that.
          Party, and bullshit, (party.)
          And party, and bullshit, (bullshit.)
          And party, and bullshit, (party.)
          And party, and bullshit, (bullshit.)
          And party, and bullshit, (yea, junior mafia likes that.)
          And party, and bullshit,
          And party, and bullshit, (uptown likes that.)
          And party, and bullshit,
          And party, and bullshit, (bad boy likes that.)
          And party, and bullshit,
